**Project Name:** Call Centre Data Analysis Dashboard in Power BI

**Project Description:**

The goal of this project was to analyze call centre performance data by creating an interactive and insightful dashboard to help managers identify trends and key performance metrics. The project aimed to provide a comprehensive view of the call center's operations, focusing on calls made, reasons for the calls, and the sentiment expressed by customers across various regions.

**Development Process:**
I developed this project by importing raw call centre data into Power BI, transforming and cleaning the data as necessary. Using DAX functions, I calculated key metrics like response time, total call duration, and average call duration. I created visualizations to display total calls by day, by reason, by state, by sentiment, and by city. The home dashboard also features slicers for date range, channel, and city, offering a dynamic and customizable user experience. Additionally, I placed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time and total calls as cards on the dashboard. The second page contains a detailed table for granular data analysis.

**Important Features:**
- Dynamic slicers for date range, channel, and city.
- Visualizations to break down calls by day, reason, state, sentiment, and call center city.
- DAX-calculated metrics such as total calls, average call duration, and response time, displayed in a user-friendly card format.
- A dedicated table for detailed call data, providing a more in-depth look at the dataset.

**Conclusion:**
This dashboard serves as an essential tool for call center managers to monitor performance and improve decision-making. With real-time insights into call volume, reasons for calls, and customer sentiment, managers can identify trends and areas needing improvement, helping to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the call center operations.
